In this lab assignment, there were 2 subproblems to be solved. They were as follows:

1. Rod Cutting Problem

Given a rod of steel, you need to cut it into pieces in a way to optimize the total revenue. The
decision is where to cut the rod given that different piece lengths have different revenue.

Formally,

Given a rod of length n inches and a table of prices p[i], i=1,2,...,n, find the maximum revenue
r[n] obtainable by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

2. Strongly Connected Components

Given a directed graph, write a program that checks if the given graph is strongly connected
or not. A directed graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from
every other vertex.
