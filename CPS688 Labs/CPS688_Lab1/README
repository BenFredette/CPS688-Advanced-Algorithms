Problem - Java graph implementation using adjacency list

Use the Java language to implement a Graph using an adjacency list.
Provide implementations of the methods below:
• Add an edge between two vertices a and b. [ addEdge(a,b) ]
• Compute the degree of a vertex a. [ degreeVertex(a) ] //returns the number of
neighbors for a given vertex a.
• Print the adjacent vertices of a vertex a. [ printAdjVertices(a) ]
Given an undirected graph, you are required to create its corresponding adjacency list using the
Graph implementation above and print its vertices using Breadth First Search [ BFS ] and Depth
First Search [ DFS ].
